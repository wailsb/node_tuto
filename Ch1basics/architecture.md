# node.js single-threaded, event-driven, and non-blocking I/O model
## what does this mean?
in easy terms, Node.js is designed to handle multiple tasks at the same time without blocking the execution of other tasks. This is achieved through its event-driven architecture, which allows it to respond to events (like user input or network requests) asynchronously.
how is that possible while it is single-threaded?
Node.js uses an event loop to manage asynchronous operations. When a task is initiated (like reading a file or making a network request), Node.js offloads that task to the system's underlying APIs, allowing the main thread to continue executing other code. Once the task is complete, a callback function is triggered to handle the result.
## and what if multiple tasks or requests come in at the same time?
great question! Node.js can handle multiple requests simultaneously because it doesn't wait for one task to finish before starting another. Instead, it uses a non-blocking I/O model, which means that while one task is waiting for a response (like a database query), Node.js can continue processing other tasks or requests.
isn't it single-threaded though?
yes, Node.js is single-threaded in the sense that it runs on a single main thread
each request comes in, it is added to the event loop queue. The event loop processes these requests one by one, but because of its non-blocking nature, it can handle many requests efficiently without waiting for each one to complete before moving on to the next.
## what is queue?
it's a data structure in which elements are added to the end and removed from the front, following the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. In Node.js, the event loop uses a queue to manage asynchronous tasks and callbacks.
## what about tasks taking a long time to complete?
if a task takes a long time to complete, it can block the event loop and prevent other tasks from being processed. To avoid this, Node.js provides mechanisms like worker threads and child processes to offload heavy computations or blocking operations to separate threads or processes, allowing the main thread to remain responsive.
## what is event loop?
next chapter will cover this in detail, but in short, the event loop is a core part of Node.js that continuously checks for events and executes the associated callbacks. It allows Node.js to handle asynchronous operations efficiently by managing the execution of code in response to events.

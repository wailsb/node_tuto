### 🧩 1.2 Visualized Folder

Inside the repo, you'll find a folder called **`visualized`** containing:

- 🎨 A **Next.js app for each chapter**, visualizing the concepts through animations and examples.
- 📁 Each chapter has **its own standalone Next.js app** to keep things clean and easy to navigate.
- ✨ It’s fun and intuitive — especially great for visual learners!

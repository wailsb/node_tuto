# how lessons are structured
This repository is structured to provide a clear and progressive learning path for Node.js. Each chapter contains a set of lessons that build upon the previous ones, allowing learners to gradually deepen their understanding of Node.js concepts and practices.
## order of lessons
# -1 introduction
## file : Ch1basics/intro.md
the introduction chapter provides an overview of Node.js, its purpose, and how it differs from browser JavaScript. It sets the stage for understanding the environment in which Node.js operates and introduces key concepts that will be explored in subsequent chapters.
# -2 commands
## file : Ch1basics/cmdHelpful.md
this chapter covers various command-line commands that are useful when working with Node.js. It includes commands for checking versions, managing packages with npm, and running JavaScript files.
# -3 variables
## file : Ch1basics/variables_in_nodejs.md
this chapter focuses on variable declarations in Node.js, explaining the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`. It provides examples of how each type of variable behaves in different scopes and contexts, helping learners understand best practices for variable management in Node.js applications.
# -4 architecture
## file : Ch1basics/architecture.md
node.js is single-threaded, event-driven , and non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle multiple connections efficiently. This chapter explains the core architecture of Node.js, including the event loop, callback functions, and how Node.js manages asynchronous operations. It provides a foundation for understanding how Node.js applications are structured and how they handle concurrency.
# -5 functions
## file : Ch1basics/functions_in_nodejs.md
this chapter explores functions in Node.js, including function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions. It covers topics such as scope, closures, and the importance of `this` in different contexts, providing learners with a solid foundation for working with functions in their Node.js applications.

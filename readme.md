## what does it contains?
### 1.1
this repository contains a series of chapters that cover the basics of Node.js, including its architecture, event loop, functions, and more. Each chapter is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Node.js concepts and practices.
courses are saved as md files in which each folder name respresents a chapter. The files are structured to include explanations, code examples, and exercises to reinforce learning.
code sourse in js is provided if you want to try it yourself.
### 1.2
there is a folder named visualized in which it contains a next application for each chapter animated with example and it is cool if you want to check it out.
i could've just put all chapters in one next application but i wanted to keep it simple and easy to navigate.
each chapter has it's own next application .

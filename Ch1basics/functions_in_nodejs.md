# Functions in Node.js
this should be easy as we covered complex concepts like event loop and architecture, so functions should be a piece of cake.
also we'll cover async functions and callbacks in this chapter.
## Function Declarations
function declarations are the most common way to define functions in Node.js. They can be called before they are defined due to hoisting.
### Example:
```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
sayHello(); // Output: Hello, World!
```
## Function Expressions
function expressions are defined as part of an expression and can be anonymous or named. They are not hoisted, meaning they cannot be called before they are defined.
### Example:
```js
const greet = function(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```
## Arrow Functions
arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions. They do not have their own `this` context, which makes them useful in certain scenarios, especially when dealing with callbacks.
### Example:
```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
console.log(add(5, 10)); // Output: 15
```
## Scope and Closures
scope refers to the visibility of variables and functions in different parts of your code. In Node.js, functions can create closures, which are functions that remember the environment in which they were created.
### Example of Closure:
```js
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = "I am outside!";
  
  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Accesses outerVariable from the outer function
  }
  
  return innerFunction;
}
const inner = outerFunction();
inner(); // Output: I am outside!
```
## The `this` Keyword
the `this` keyword in Node.js refers to the context in which a function is called. In regular functions, `this` refers to the object that called the function. In arrow functions, `this` retains the value of the enclosing lexical context.
### Example of `this` in Regular Function:
```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  }
};
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```
### Example of `this` in Arrow Function:
```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet: () => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  }
};
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined!
```
## Async Functions and Callbacks
async functions allow you to write asynchronous code in a more readable way using the `async` and `await` keywords. They return a promise and can be used with callbacks to handle asynchronous operations.
### Example of Async Function:
```js

async function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched!");
    }, 2000);
  });
}
fetchData().then((data) => {
  console.log(data); // Output: Data fetched!
});
```
### Example of Callback Function:
```js
function fetchDataWithCallback(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Data fetched with callback!");
  }, 2000);
}

fetchDataWithCallback((data) => {
  console.log(data); // Output: Data fetched with callback!
});
```
### await example:
```js
async function fetchDataWithAwait() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  console.log(data); // Output: Data fetched!
}
fetchDataWithAwait();
```
## Summary
in this chapter, we explored various aspects of functions in Node.js, including function declarations, expressions
and arrow functions, scope and closures, the `this` keyword, and asynchronous functions with callbacks. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable Node.js applications.

# node js vs browser
### key differences between Node.js and browser JavaScript
while both Node.js and browser JavaScript share the same core language (JavaScript), they serve different environments and have distinct features. Here are some key differences:
node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run on the server side, while browsers are client-side environments that execute JavaScript for user interactions.
## what does this actually mean?
code that you write in js to be executed with node.js is actually taken and run by the V8 engine, which is the same engine that runs JavaScript in Chrome. However, Node.js provides additional features and APIs that are not available in the browser environment, such as file system access, networking capabilities, and server-side modules.
### is code compiled or interpreted?
JavaScript is primarily an interpreted language, meaning that it is executed line by line at runtime. However, modern JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Node.js and Chrome) employ Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation techniques to optimize performance by compiling frequently executed code into machine code during execution.
### does this means js is slow or fast?
JavaScript is generally considered fast due to JIT compilation and optimizations in modern engines. However, performance can vary based on the complexity of the code, the environment (Node.js vs. browser), and how well the code is written. Node.js is particularly efficient for I/O-bound tasks due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
### why would I use node.js?
Node.js is used for building server-side applications, APIs, and real-time applications due to its non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle many connections simultaneously. It is particularly well-suited for applications that require high concurrency, such as chat applications, streaming services, and RESTful APIs.
if you're confused dw we'll cover this in more detail in the next chapters.
## is typescript the same as JavaScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, which means TypeScript code can run anywhere JavaScript runs, including Node.js and browsers. TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, making it easier to maintain large codebases.
### so typescript is???
it is a language that adds typesecurity to JavaScript, allowing developers to define variable types, interfaces, and classes. This helps catch errors early in the development process and improves code readability and maintainability.
also add features such as oobject-oriented programming, interfaces, and generics, which are not present in standard JavaScript.
but the actual code that runs in Node.js or the browser is still plain JavaScript, as TypeScript compiles down to it.
### which means that...
any code written in TypeScript will be transpiled to JavaScript before execution, ensuring compatibility with the JavaScript runtime environments.
